# Concentration-Calculator
A handy tool which can save you time in calculating concentrations of solutions or dilutions.

Extracts data from a library (chemicals_list.txt) in which is saved the names, and molar mass. Will create this file upon first running.
Also reads a trendy new icon (icon.png), but will function without.

Can use the GUI to add-in new chemicals to the library and then use them in calculations immediately.
Re-wrote old version (frankly, to be better) and implemented PyQt6 in place of TKinter.

Can now store values in the GUI to speed up notetaking and experiment planning.
