# Concentration-Calculator
A handy tool which can save you time in calculating concentrations of solutions or dilutions.

Extracts data from a library (species.txt) in which is saved the names, molar mass, and density of chemical species.

Can use the GUI to add-in new chemicals to the library and then use them in calculations immediately.

Please stress-test this GUI for me!
